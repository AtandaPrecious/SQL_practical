## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **retail sales data** using SQL.  
It involves **data cleaning**, **exploration**, and answering **business-related questions** to uncover customer behavior, sales patterns, and product performance.  

The goal is to demonstrate how SQL can be applied to transform raw transactional data into actionable insights.

- Transaction ID  
- Sale date & time  
- Customer demographics (ID, gender, age)  
- Product category  
- Quantity sold  
- Cost of goods sold (COGS)  
- Total sale amount  

📎 Both the dataset and SQL query file are available in this repository.
